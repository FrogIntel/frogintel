Hey Frens, a team of Admins and Anons inside the truther community have compiled a redpill 💊 Android 🤖 application called Frog Intel 🐸, launched May 5th 2023.

During 2023 it was removed from the Play Store and asked by Google to be dumbed down removing any contradicting health information regarding COVID-19. This included removing entire sections, so we left it in.
