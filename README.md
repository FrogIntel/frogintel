🆕 Frog Intel Android application has been BANNED from Google Play Store in recent months, but is STILL AVAILABLE and going 💪

Hey Frens, a team of Admins and Anons inside the truther community have compiled a redpill 💊 Android 🤖 application called Frog Intel 🐸, launched May 5th 2023 for early release testing.

In recent months it has been removed from the Play Store and asked by Google to be dumbed down removing any contradicting health information regarding COVID-19. This included removing entire sections such as Conspyre.tv, so we left it in.

It is designed to filter out a majority of the fakes, shills and trolls inside the movement spreading disinformation & misinformation. Providing you with OSINT tools alongside the Intel.
